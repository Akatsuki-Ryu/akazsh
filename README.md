when it is installing , it will apprear to finish the command and standby , because it creates a new session but that session is over. 
so you need to quit the current session to make it continue by typing `exit` and press enter.
when all the setups are done , you will also see the command has been finished and standby, you can safely type `exit` and press enter to quit the session.
