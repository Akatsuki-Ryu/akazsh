Use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) to translate anything you need.

> This workflow requires an API key for Google Translate. You must pay to use the API, but using it is ridiculously cheap. See the [pricing information](https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/pricing). To get an API, read through Google's [Getting Started Docs](https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/getting_started). You do not need to read through them all, but you need to follow them up until you have created an API key that you can then set in this workflow.

Enable / Disable any of the 80 or so available languages. You'll see the simulataneous translation of all of the languages that you enable. Just select any text to copy the translation to your clipboard.

Translations are cached for a bit of speed.

Langauge Icons come from the [Nordic Factory](www.nordicfactory.com) with the best possible matches for language to country.
